#Reversi-Othello 
##A Reversi-Othello game with simple terminal graphics, coded in Java. Made with https://github.com/faycode7.

The player (you) can select the depth until which the computer will be searching to make a move, using
a MiniMax algorithm, as well as who will be playing first. Using MiniMax, the computer makes the move 
with the most or least value, depending on whether it's playing first or second. This process is 
repeated until the game reaches a terminal state.

######The computer often breaks the game's rules. This indicates a problem with MiniMax- will be fixed at some point.
